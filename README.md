The CoPiCo is a cartridge for the Tandy Color Computer that adds WiFi to and serves as a boot ROM for the system.

It is built around the official dev board for the RP2040 microcontroller, the Raspberry Pi Pico W, which includes onboard WiFi.

This site is a work in progress. It will soon contain documentation and project updates.

You can find the KiCad source for the board and the source code for the microcontroller firmware in the following repos:
- [github.com/thomasshanks/copico-board](https://github.com/thomasshanks/copico-board)
- [github.com/thomasshanks/copico-firmware](https://github.com/thomasshanks/copico-firmware)


## Signage from Unveiling at the Vintage Computer Festival SoCal

Until we get a chance to create a better site, here's a look at the board and our booth signage from the grand unveiling of the project at VCF SoCal!
